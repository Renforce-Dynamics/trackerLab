# Dataset Download

The first step is to download the data.

## Method 1: Using CMU FBX

1. Install FBX SDK (see: https://github.com/nv-tlabs/ASE/issues/61).
2. Follow [Expressive Humanoid](https://github.com/chengxuxin/expressive-humanoid) to retarget .fbx files to .npy motion format.

## Method 2: Using AMASS (recommended)

1. Download the amass dataset, and put them in the `./data/amass/`. (You can follow the steps in the [amass](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de).)
2. Unzip the file, and organize them.

The final data folder structure and usage is detailed in [data folder readme](../data/README.md).
